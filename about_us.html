    <h1>Our names are Angelica and Isabella. Angelica is 16, and Isabella is 13. We started coding together two years ago after casual online experimentation triggered our interest. We spend 2-4 hours a week studying coding with a tutor. Angelica is also completing an internship in coding at the Museum of Natural History. We hope to continue coding for the rest of our lives. </h1>

    <h1> We started Harlem Coding Kids because we wish that there had been a program like this for us, so that we could have started learning when we were even younger. We want to pass on what we've learned by teaching kids how to code, giving them valuable skills that they will have for the rest of their lives. </h1>

    <h1> What we do 
    <br>
    <br>
    We offer a ten week course where your child will get a basic knowledge of coding in Python. By the end of the program, he/she will be able to make basic computer games and tests. As one of the most important aspects of the present and future, learning to code can be a very useful skill for your everyday life! We have used coding to create several websites, including this one! We have also used it for making coding games like rock paper scissors and creating tests to help ourselves study for school. </h1>
