    <h1>For more information or to join one of our classes, please email us at harlemtutoring@gmail.com. Please include the parent’s/guardian’s name and the child’s name and age. Please also let us know about any background your child has in coding if any—although no experience is needed. We would also like to know what they wish to accomplish by learning to code. It is first-come first-served, and there is limited space in this class. If you are placed on the waitlist, we will let you know if space becomes available and also keep you informed on future sessions.  </h1>
