  	<br>
	<h1> 
		<ul>
			<li> By learning to code, your children will learn to see and understand the world in a way that they wouldn’t otherwise! They will learn to break down problems into smaller parts, and think logically to come up with solutions. </li>
			<br>
			<li> In addition to improving your resume and college application, learning to code is an enjoyable experience when taught in a fun and engaging way as we aim to do. </li>

			<li> Technology is the future. According to Code.com, 71% of new jobs in STEM are in computer science, but only 25% of schools teach it. That's where we come in. </li> 
	<br>
			<li> At Harlem Coding Kids, our goal is to teach computer science to children who don't have access to it. Coding contributes to almost all aspects of modern life, your cell phone, tv, cars, and even traffic lights. </li> </h1>
	<br>
	<h1> 	<li> By learning to code now, your children will not only get a head start in their stem education, but a head start in their careers and their life. </li>
