    <h1>Lesson 1 - Intro to Python.  In the first lesson, we will be going over the basics of Python, confirming that everyoneâ€™s software is up to date, and going over the basic functions, such as print.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lesson 2 - Mathematical Operations  - In the second lesson, we will be doing a review of the functions we learned in our previous class learn 1 - 2 more simple functions and learn how to do math computations (+ - * / = %).

    <h1> Lesson 3 - Libraries -  Part of the reason Python is such a great first language to learn is because there are so many people who write code for others to use.  Some of the most accessible of this open source code is in libraries that others can use for free.  Some include Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas
    <br>
    <br>
    Lesson 4 - Data Collection Part I - In this lesson, we will learn how to hold and collect data in lists.

    <h1> Lesson 5 - Conditionals - 
    <br>Conditionals are statements that tell a computer what to do in specific conditions. A real-life example is;  if it is raining, bring an umbrella, or else, do not bring an umbrella. This week, we will learn how to tell a computer how to do this.
    <br>
    <br>
    Lesson 6 - Loops- This week, we will do a review of conditionals, and begin learning about for loops. A for loop tells a computer to perform a certain task a certain amount of times.

    <h1> Lesson 7 - Review - This lesson will be a review of what we have already learned, specifically conditionals and for loops. 
    <br>
    <br>
    8 - Data Collection Part II - Dictionaries are a more advanced way to hold and collect data.  We will learn how to create and use dictionaries, as well as how to manipulate them to optimize for our needs.

    <h1> Lesson 9 - Functions - We will learn how to create our very own functions much like the ones we have been using. We write a function that uses everything that we have learned. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Lesson 10 - The End - Time for any lingering question and to finish up our functions.  </h1>
